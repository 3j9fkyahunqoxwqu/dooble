	  <h3><b>Dooble 2.0 (2017.11.05)</b></h3>
	  Welcome to the <b>2.0 (2017.11.05)</b> release of Dooble! Dooble 2.0 is a brand new Web browser. New icons, new logic, new source, new themes. Everything is new! Let's take a brief tour of some of the new features.
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Authentically-encrypted database containers are included. The optional feature includes the popular cipher algorithms AES and Threefish as well as the fantastic SHA-3 digest algorithm. Please note that both implementations of AES and Threefish are written by the author(s) of Dooble.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Automatic and periodic removal of cookie data may be of interest. This feature allows Dooble to purge unwanted cookie data from your browsing history.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Beautiful dictionaries are included covering various languages. When enabled, spell checking is too.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Built-in content blocker with accept and block modes of operation. This new addition will prevent advertising sites from polluting your browsing experience. The feature may also be used in a school setting where it's desired that only specific sites may be accessed.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Completely redesigned! Most of the major operating systems are supported, including your favorite Unix-like systems as well as Windows. Wherever Qt and WebEngine are supported, so is Dooble!
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Dooble is highly-configurable software. The internal workings are clearly visible. Tool tips are included wherever confusion may arise.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Dooble is open source software and includes a very relaxed BSD license.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Proxy support is of course included. Whether you enjoy using a private proxy or a public proxy, Dooble is attentive to your privacy.
	    </li>
	    <li>Qt 5.9.x and newer are required! WebKit has been deprecated and WebEngine is now the preferred layout engine for rendering Web pages. Release 2.0 (2017.11.05) includes Qt 5.9.2 libraries.</li>
	    <li>
	      Zero-dependency browser. The only entities that Dooble requires are Qt and you!
	    </li>
	  </ul>
