  <title>Dooble Release Notes</title>
  <div class="css">
    <p>
      Welcome to the 2017.11.05 release of Dooble! Let's take a brief tour of some of the new features.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Dooble 2.0 is a brand new Web browser. That's right, the browser includes totally new logic. Everything is new!
	</li>
	<li>
	  Authentically-encrypted database containers are included. The optional feature includes the popular cipher algorithms AES and Threefish as well as the fantastic SHA-3 digest algorithm. Please note that both implementations of AES and Threefish are written by the author(s) of Dooble.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Automatic and periodic removal of cookie data may be of interest. This feature allows Dooble to purge unwanted cookie data from your browsing history.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Built-in content blocker with accept and block modes of operation. This new addition will prevent advertising sites from polluting your browsing experience. The feature may also be used in a school setting where it's desired that only specific sites may be accessed.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Completely redesigned! Most of the major operating systems are supported, including your favorite Unix-like systems as well as Windows. Wherever Qt and WebEngine are supported, so is Dooble!
	</li>
	<li>
	  Dooble is highly-configurable software. The internal workings are clearly visible. Tool tips are included wherever confusion may arise.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Dooble is open source software and includes a very relaxed BSD license.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Proxy support is of course included. Whether you enjoy using a private proxy or a public one such as Tor, Dooble is attentive to your privacy.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Beautiful dictionaries are included covering various languages. When enabled, spell checking is too.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Dooble 2.0 is a zero-dependency browser. The only entities that Dooble requires are Qt and you!
	</li>
      </ul>
