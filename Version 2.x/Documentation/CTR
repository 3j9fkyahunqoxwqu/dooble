Dooble supports the CTR mode of operation.

Authenticated and encrypted values are stored in various databases.
The format of the stored objects is H(E(P || Length(P))) || E(P || Length(P)).

Please note that a session state is maintained. The function
gcry_randomize() is used for obtaining a partial buffer of random data.
The remaining portion of the buffer is occupied by the number of milliseconds
since 1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC. The number of milliseconds is incremented
by a session counter. If the selected cipher's block length is less than
the width of a 64-bit integer, gcry_randomize() is solely used.

If you are concerned, please avoid using the CTR mode.
