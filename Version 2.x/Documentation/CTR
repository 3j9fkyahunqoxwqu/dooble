Dooble supports the CTR mode of operation.

Authenticated and encrypted values are stored in various databases.
The format of the stored objects is H(E(P || Length(P))) || E(P || Length(P)).

Please note that state is not maintained. The function
gcry_randomize() is used for obtaining a buffer of random data.

If this is a concern, please avoid using the CTR mode.
